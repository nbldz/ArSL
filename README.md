 Approach

Arabic Sign Language recognition using tools like MediaPipe and Transformers is an exciting area of research that combines computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. Here's an overview of how you could approach this:

1. MediaPipe for Hand Tracking
MediaPipe is a cross-platform framework developed by Google that provides real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition. It can detect hand landmarks, which are crucial for recognizing sign language gestures.

Hand Tracking Pipeline: You can use MediaPipe's Hand Solution to track the hand movements and extract key landmarks (21 points per hand). These landmarks include the position of fingers, joints, and the palm.
Feature Extraction: For each sign, you'd collect sequences of these landmarks over time. The trajectory of these landmarks would serve as features for further processing.

2. Transformers for Sequence Modeling
Once you have the hand landmarks, you can process them with a sequence model. Transformers, particularly models like BERT, GPT, or T5, are powerful in handling sequential data, making them ideal for understanding gestures over time.

Input to Transformers: You can use the hand landmark coordinates over time as inputs to a Transformer model. Depending on your approach, you might treat each frame of hand coordinates as a "token."
Sign Language to Text: The model would learn to map sequences of hand landmarks (or gestures) to corresponding Arabic words or phrases in text.
